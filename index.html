      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <p>I am a fitness instructor and I have just moved back home 
        to the Bay Area, from New York City, to start a new, exciting
        chapter in my life!
      </p>
      <h1>Where I'm From</h1>
      <p>San Francisco, CA</p>
      <h1>What are your favorite hobbies?</h1>
      <p>I like to skateboard, play the guitar, go to music festivals, meet
        new people, learn new things, and stay very active!
      </p>

      <p>I think it would be pretty rad to be a DJ</p>
      <h1>Where do you live?</h1>

      <h1>Why do you want to be a web developer?</h1>
      <p>I am looking to expand. To challenge myself so I can grow in
        new ways, and be able to create something of value that can be 
        a light in the darknessnesses of our current world. I want to 
        be better and I want to find a way to make this world better!
